# Sun-Salutations
## Inspiration
    * Sun Salutations was inspired by an expanding cards tutorial from a Udemy course. 
    * I focus on accessibility when teaching yoga and I wanted to translate that to my code as well.

## Technologies
    * HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
    * Adobe XD

## Focus
    * Accessible and responsible design

## Challenge(s)
    * Image optimization
        * This was handled utilizing the srcset attribute and pivoting the image display approach. Initially images were styled as expanding cards but I decided to use a slideshow instead so that not all images would be loaded at once.
